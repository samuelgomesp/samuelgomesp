## Hi there :space_invader:

My name is Samuel, I'm a full stack developer in training, I'm from Brasília, Federal District. I love programming and developing programs, what fascinates me about programming is the fact that there are countless possibilities to solve a problem or create something new.

- :seedling: I'm currently studying TypeScript
- 👩‍💻 I'm interested in technology and how it can help us evolve
- :abcd: Intermediate English
- :books: At the moment I'm just studying, looking for my first job in the field.
